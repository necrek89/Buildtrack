      <Section title="1. Agreement to Terms">
        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of {COMPANY} (the "Service"), a
        construction crew and project management application. By creating an account or using the Service,
        you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>
      </Section>
      <Section title="2. The Service">
        <p>{COMPANY} lets construction foremen and their teams manage projects, tasks, materials, tools,
        attendance, and payments. You are responsible for the accuracy of the data you and your team enter
        into the Service.</p>
      </Section>
      <Section title="3. Free Trial">
        <p>New foreman accounts receive a 30-day free trial with full access to all features. No payment
        method is required to start a trial. After the trial ends, creating, editing, or deleting data is
        blocked until you subscribe to a paid plan — your existing data remains visible and is never deleted
        for non-payment.</p>
      </Section>
      <Section title="4. Subscriptions and Billing">
        <p>Paid plans (Standard and Pro) are billed monthly or annually, as selected at checkout. Payments are
        processed by <strong>Paddle.com Market Limited</strong>, our payment provider and Merchant of Record.
        Paddle handles payment collection, taxes, and invoicing on our behalf; by subscribing, you also agree
        to <a href="https://www.paddle.com/legal/checkout-buyer-terms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Paddle's Buyer Terms</a>.
        Subscriptions renew automatically at the end of each billing period unless cancelled beforehand.</p>
      </Section>
      <Section title="5. Cancellation">
        <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings. Cancellation takes effect
        at the end of the current billing period; you retain access until then. See our
        <span onClick={() => nav('/refund')} style={{ color: 'var(--ld-orange)', cursor: 'pointer' }}> Refund Policy</span> for
        details on refunds.</p>
      </Section>
      <Section title="6. Account Responsibilities">
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all
        activity under your account. Foreman accounts are responsible for the workers and managers they invite
        into their team.</p>
      </Section>
      <Section title="7. Your Data">
        <p>You retain ownership of all project, task, and team data you submit to the Service. We do not sell

        use it to store unlawful content.</p>
      </Section>
      <Section title="9. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability">
        <p>The Service is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by

        of the Service.</p>

      <Section title="10. Changes to These Terms">
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service after changes take effect
        constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
